# CS4760P1
In this project, i have created 3 files that are oss.c (parent), user.c (child)  and makefile. The basic jist of this project is that parent launches processes based on the arguments provided. I have used getopt to parse command line options. The default values are all set to 1 for all three arguments (n: number of processes, s: simultaneous processes and -t: iterations). 

To run this program use: 
./oss -n <enter number> -s <enter number> -t <enter number>
